What is Jeannie?
================
We from Pannous developed several features for our Voice Agent called
Jeannie, which is available on the Android and Apple market.
Now its time for you to teach Jeannie your own stuff!


What is this?
=============

This is a demo of how to extend Jeannie - for Android only at the moment.
With the server its possible to send your spoken words from Jeannie to any browser!


Installation
============

1. Download Jeannie
   https://market.android.com/details?id=com.pannous.voice.actions.free&hl=en

2. Create an Android project and install plugin4android on your 
   Android device. Be sure you customized the IP to you local machine.
   So that it accesses you server and not jetsli.de:3000

3. Install nodejs v0.6.2 and npm for the server.
   Then install the following packages:
   express jade nib socket.io stylus


Tests
=====

Add more tests and features if you like!
The jasmine tests are located at /spec/*.spec.js


How to create your own plugin
=============================

Add this to your Manifest:
<receiver android:name="com.example.voice.actions.plugin.VoiceActionsTestReceiver">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.pannous.voice.ACTION" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>

implement your BroadcastReceiver:

 @Override
 public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
 // what did Jeannie hear?
 // SpeechRecognizer.RESULTS_RECOGNITION
 String input = intent.getStringExtra("input");

 // save feedback for Jeannie here:
 Bundle results = getResultExtras(true);


PluginParams:

 // let Jeannie and other plugins know if the action was already handled
 public static final String HANDLED = "HANDLED";

 // let Jeannie know which plugin reacted
 public static final String HANDLED_BY = "HANDLED_BY";

 // let Jeannie speak the answer
 public static final String RESPONSE="RESPONSE";

 // let Jeannie learn which keywords belong to this Action!
 public static final String KEYWORDS = "KEYWORDS";

 // let Jeannie know the context
 public static final String SOURCE = "SOURCE";

 // tell Jeannie to keep listening!
 public static final String LISTEN_IN_BACKGROUND= "LISTEN_IN_BACKGROUND";

 // give Jeannie an action
 public static final String ACTION= "ACTION";

 // let Jeannie NOT speak when she performs the ACTION
 public static final String QUIET="QUIET";

 // let Jeannie know the subject/topic of this context (might not apply)
 public static final String SUBJECT = "SUBJECT";

 // let Jeannie know the person in this context (might not apply)
 public static final String PERSON = "PERSON";


Let us know your idea - who knows - we might incorporate it into the official Jeannie
and give you some revenue share :) !
