What is Jeannie?
================
We from Pannous developed several features for our Voice Agent called
Jeannie, which is available on the Android and Apple market.
Now its time for you to teach Jeannie your own stuff!


What is this?
=============

This is a demo of how to extend Jeannie - for Android only at the moment.
With the server its possible to send your spoken words from Jeannie 
to any browser!


Installation
============

1. Download and install Jeannie
   https://market.android.com/details?id=com.pannous.voice.actions.free&hl=en

2. Create an Android project and install plugin4android on your Android 
   device. Customize the IP to point to the local node.js server.
   Otherwise it will use our test instance at jetsli.de:3000

3. Optionally:
   Install nodejs v0.6.2 and npm for the server.
   Then install the following packages:
   express jade nib socket.io stylus
   Then start the node.js server

4. Now start the web2voice plugin and click the button.
   Start a browser (which supports web sockets) on any operating system 
   and point it to http://jetsli.de:3000 or your custom address. 
   Your spoken words should pop up in (near) real time in the browser!

5. Put the server anywhere on the web and impress your friends!


Tests
=====

Add more tests and features if you like!
The jasmine tests are located at /spec/*.spec.js
